## Introduction

Remi-lang is a esoteric programming language that inspired by the charismatic vampire of the Scarlet devil Remilia Scarlet from [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project). This programming language can be compiled or intepreted although the available feature might be vary.

Additional Note:

- Core: Core feature of the language
- FFI: Allow you to import external shared library

## Dependency

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) - Compiler written in
- [Fasm](https://flatassembler.net/) - Assembler that compile assembly code into .o file that the Remi-lang compiler generated
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - Link the .o file into final executable (for windows I recommend using msys2/mingw one)

## Quickstart

```sh
# Install the compiler from git repo without cloning manually
cargo install --git https://github.com/UnknownRori/remi-lang/

# Congratulation it installed on your path
remi --help
```

### Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UnknownRori/remi-lang
cd remi-lang

# Test the lexer and parser
cargo test

# Install it into global path
cargo install --path .
```
